# amicus-agricola

CodeFunDo++ 2018
Amicus means friend in latin and agricola means farming in latin.

## Theme

Our work is about to predict occurrence of natural disaster(here drought) by forecasting amount of rainfall. 

## Aim

We aim  to develop an application that will predict probabilistic distribution of hourly rain given polarimetric radar measurements.
We will also try and predict the amount of rainfall which will enable government to tell farmers about the pattern of rainfall beforehand and thisâ€™ll in turn help farmers to plan and utilise their resources in an efficient way and future possibilities of drought may completely be eradicated out. 

## Our Solution

Using the datasets which are publically available, about weather and rainfall data, we would train an analytics model which helps in forecasting amount of rainfall in future with a considerable high accuracy.

## Working

We would make a website which continuously takes input data from various sources, transmits it to our API endpoints on Azure cloud where we would have kept our trained models to return weather predictions which would be displayed on the website.
